### SwiftUI Live project restructured using the MVVM architecture

This repository starts from the "SwiftUI Live: Building an app from scratch" demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SroTB1buuD0 . (The code is  available here https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftOnSundays/tree/main/022%20Pairs )

It then restructures that code using the MVVM architecture as taught in the Stanford University SwiftUI course CS193P at https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/ . Lecture 2 covers the basics of the architecture.

This has been done as a learning exercise. Please add any comments, discussion, or suggestions for improvement to the Issues.
